Module "FMSTR1"    (component FreeMaster)
   - FMSTR1_Poll -In the poll-driven or short interrupt modes, this function handles the protocol decoding and execution. In 
                the poll-driven mode, this function also handles the SCI communication. In the long interrupt mode, this 
                function compiles as an empty function and may still be called.
   - FMSTR1_Recorder -Recorder worker routine. This returns quickly if recorder is not running, otherwise it calls quite 
                lengthy recorder routine which does all the recorder work (sampling, triggering).   This method is enabled only 
                if the Recorder property is enabled.
   - FMSTR1_TriggerRec -Pull the trigger of the recorder. This function starts the post-trigger stop countdown.  This method is 
                enabled only if the Recorder property is enabled.

Module "GPIOE"     (component Init_GPIO_VAR3)
   - GPIOE_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC56F82748VLH)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Sets low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see this CPU documentation.   
                Release from wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Sets low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see this CPU documentation.
